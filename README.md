# ConwaysGameOfLife-Blazor
Conway's Game of Life Implemented in Blazor.

TODO Lists:
1. WorldEditor.Save() has a bug (when try to bulk copy state array, and new array is larger then old array, out of bound exception)
	Check WorldEditor.Reset() as well
	Need more tests for those
2. Inject game core engine via DI. (Done more review?)
